		<h2>1.listen and read</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Mark: Hi, Nam. Your book must be very interesting. What are you reading? </p>
		</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: I'm reading a really good book in English called Last Night I Dreamed of Peace: The Diary of Dang Thuy Tram.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Mark: Dang Thuy Tram? Who is she?</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: She was born in Hue in 1942. She studied medicine in Ha Noi, and volunteered to join the army at the age of 24, working as a surgeon during the resistance war against the US.</p>
<br>
<p>Mark: That's when she started her diary, isn't it?</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: Yes. She wrote her diary while she was working in a field hospital in Quang Ngai Province. The diary contains personal accounts of her experiences during the war and shows her love for her family and country.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Mark: Wow! It sounds interesting. Is she still alive?</p>
<br>
<p>Nam: Unfortunately, she was killed by the enemy while she was doing her duty in the jungle in Quang Ngai Province. She was only 27 then.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Mark: Oh, that's really sad. But how did people find her diary?</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: An American soldier found it and saved it from being burnt. Then more than 30 years after Tram's death, a copy was returned to her mother. The diary was published in Viet Nam in 2005. It has also been translated into several other languages.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Mark: That's amazing!</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: Now she is considered a national hero for devoting her youth and whole life to saving other people's lives in the war.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Mark: Can you lend me the book when you finish reading it? I'd like to read it myself.</p>
</br>
<br>
<p>Nam: Sure!</p>
